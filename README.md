# L101-compiler

This is a BASIC-like language compiler for the Olivetti Programma P101.

I created this a couple of years ago, mostly to learn Xtext.

I have decided to release this in the public now, in occasion of the 60th anniversary of Programma 101.

## Status

Currently, you can only launch the project from within Eclipse.

You need Xtext 24.0 Eclipse plugin and Java 21 installed to run the project.

Launch the application as an "Eclipse Application", create a Java project in the application workbench (you will be prompted to turn it into an Xtext project, say yes) and create a .l101 file; it will be automatically compiled when you save it or when you clean the project (this is a good way to recompile all examples).

The runtime-workbench contains an example workbench with many examples.
